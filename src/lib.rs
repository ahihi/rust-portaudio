//! # rust-portaudio
//!
//! __PortAudio__ bindings for Rust
//!
//! PortAudio provides a uniform application programming interface (API) across all
//! supported platforms.  You can think of the PortAudio library as a wrapper that
//! converts calls to the PortAudio API into calls to platform-specific native audio
//! APIs. Operating systems often offer more than one native audio API and some APIs
//! (such as JACK) may be available on multiple target operating systems.
//! PortAudio supports all the major native audio APIs on each supported platform.
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! rust-portaudio's build script will check to see if you have already installed
//! PortAudio on your system. If not, it will attempt to automatically download and
//! install it for you. If this fails, please let us know by posting an issue at [our
//! github repository] (https://github.com/jeremyletang/rust-portaudio).
//!
//! If you'd prefer to install it manually, you can download it directly from the website:
//! [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/download.html).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Add rust-portaudio to your project by adding the dependency to your Cargo.toml as follows:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! portaudio = "*"
//! ```
//!
